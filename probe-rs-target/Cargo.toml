[features]
# serde(skip_serializing_if) breaks with `bincode`, because it doesn't encode metadata (field names).
# Enable this if you want to serialize to bincode. Do not enable this if you want to serialize to other formats (YAML, JSON...)
# https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1732
# https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode/issues/326
